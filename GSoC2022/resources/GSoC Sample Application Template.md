> ***Note**: Make sure to include the sub-org name in the title both in Google's system and in your document.*

## About me
1. Name (and nicknames like your github and irc usernames)
2. University / program / year / expected graduation date
3. Contact info (email, phone, etc.)
4. Which timezone(s) will you primarily be in during the summer
5. How much time will you be able to commit to this project
6. Related Technical Skills (please outline any prior experience you have, especially where it relates to technical skills that are needed for the above project. You can link a resume if you want).

## Project information
1. Sub-org name
2. Project Abstract
3. Detailed description

> *We will be looking for the following:*
>
> - *Specific ideas that build on the original project idea, with a strong focus on what's the minimum viable product.*
> - *Sufficient detail (e.g. references to particular files and methods) to convince us that the applicant is not hand-waving, and has a very good understanding of both the scope of the problem and the existing codebase.*
> - *Clarity of communication.*

4. Weekly timeline

   > *Break the project into weeks and estimate what you will have complete at the end of each one.  This schedule can be adjusted later if need be. Please include a well-defined and fairly detailed weekly schedule, with clear milestones and deliverables around it. List any prepwork you want to do before coding starts.*

   * **Week 1** (May 27-31): You must start coding this week (unless you've made a prior arrangement for exams) so this week's deliverable should be code.
   * **Week 2** (June 3)
   * **Week 3** (June 10)
   * **Week 4** (June 17)
   * **Week 5** (June 24)
   * **Week 6** (July 1)
   * **Week 7** (July 8)
   * **Week 8** (July 15)
   * **Week 9** (July 22)
   * **Week 10** (July 29)
   * **Week 11** (August 5): you may want to try to "code freeze" in week 11 and complete any tests/documentation in week 11-12.
   * **Week 12** (August 12)
   * **Final week** (August 19): This week you will be submitting your projects


## Other commitments
* List of any things that might affect your ability to work this summer. 
List any exams, classes, holidays, other jobs, weddings, etc. We can work around a lot of things, but it helps to know in advance.
